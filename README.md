# üñ•Ô∏è Java CLI Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a curated set of **Java-based command-line interface (CLI)** projects. Each project is self-contained, runs directly in the terminal, and is designed to sharpen core programming logic, input/output handling, and clean code practices.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About This Repository

Each project here is a **terminal-only Java application** ‚Äî no frontend, no database, just pure logic and user interaction via the console. These mini-projects helped me:

- Strengthen problem-solving and OOP skills
- Learn effective CLI-based I/O handling
- Focus on writing maintainable and modular code

These are great starting points for beginners and are often used in interviews or as quick coding practice.
